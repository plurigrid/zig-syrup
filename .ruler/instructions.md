# TRIFURCATION-FIRST IMPERATIVE (CRITICAL)

**TRIGGER:** When user requests work across 3+ domains/files/languages
**ACTION:** IMMEDIATELY spawn 3 Task subagents BEFORE any grep/find/read

**RATIONALE:** SplitMixTernary XOR-independence means each stream operates
without prior knowledge of siblings. Pre-searching violates this by
creating artificial dependencies.

### ENFORCEMENT:
If about to search before splitting on a trifurcation request, **STOP** 
and spawn subagents instead.
